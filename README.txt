Hello to those who like to check usernames on Fragment manually, for you (I originally used it for myself before introducing verification) I present a username checker in Telegram through a Telegram bot. You require:
- Python
- The requests library and the telebot library for the correct operation of the bot. Enjoy!

Please note that when checking for UNAVAILABLE usernames (displayed as incorrect in Telegram), the bot says that the username is available, although this is not the case.
But in any case, I think it's better than the usual manual search ;)
